Built a backend service that accepts CVs and project reports, 
comparing them with job descriptions using AI.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
1. File upload handling (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
2. Async job processing with Bull queue
3. LLM integration for evaluation
4. RESTful API design

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Node.js with TypeScript
- Express framework
- MongoDB for data storage
- Redis for queue management
- OpenAI API for AI evaluation

CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS:
- Implemented retry logic for LLM API failures
- Added rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Used queue system for long-running processes

RESULTS:
- Successfully processes evaluations asynchronously
- Provides detailed feedback on CV and project matching
- Handles multiple file formats
